1. Create a new class called DriverPath and move the reusables like waitFor()
and setDriverPath() into this class.Make these methods as Protected and Static

2. Add annotation @BeforeClass for all tests, move the initialization steps in here,
like setDriverPath() and initializing to chromedriver.

3. Created a Data.properties Property file and move all hard-coded data into this file.
Make this framework data-driven in this way.
